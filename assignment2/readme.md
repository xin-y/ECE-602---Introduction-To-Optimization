Let I0 be a grey-scale image represented by a real-valued matrix of size n√ón. Suppose
that only half of the values of I0 are known, while the other half has to be recovered
through an optimization procedure. In what follows, you will be asked to compare
the results produced by two alternative approaches:

1. Tikhonov regularizer (TR)
2. Anisotropic total variation (aTV)
